    <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.</p>

            I've read a lot of resumes, some good, some bad, and they've never had a list like this.
        </li>
        <li>
            Honestly, it would indicate to me a candidate who has extremely little hands-on experience and is desperate to pad a thin resume.
